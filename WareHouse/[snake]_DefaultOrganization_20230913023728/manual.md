The objective of the Snake Game is to control the snake and eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries.

Here are the main rules of the game:

1. The snake starts with a length of 1 and appears in the center of the game window.

2. The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the arrow keys.

3. Food items will randomly appear on the screen. The snake must eat the food to grow longer.

4. As the snake eats food, its length increases, and the game becomes more challenging.

5. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries.

6. After the game ends, you can restart the game by closing the game window and running the `main.py` file again.
